# Image-classification-using-convolutional-neural-network-project

The aim of this project is to generate the Jupyter Notebook to explore the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification.
During the exploration of the dataset, two specific algorithms or architectures were utilzed, which are LeNet and AlexNet algorithm.
