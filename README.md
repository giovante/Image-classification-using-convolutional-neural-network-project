# Image-classification-using-convolutional-neural-network-project

The aim of this project is to generate the Jupyter Notebook to explore the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classi􀂦cation.
During this exploration of the dataset, two speci􀂦c algorithms or architectures were utilzed, which are LeNet and AlexNet algorithm.
